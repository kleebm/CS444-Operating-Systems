My shell currently implements cd, pwd, exit, echo, help,history, kill and clear.
The cd command if given no input will just print out the current directory
It also correctly outputs the username, hostname, and login as the prompt.
It will correctly execute a program however. I used my script.py to test the functionality of the exec command
I got the pipe to work as 2 commands however the input transfer does not work.
The redir and back are not implemented as well as the jobs and was not sure if kill is correctly implemented.
The user is not prompted when they try to leave and a process is still running.

The resources i used were the internet (stack overflow) and people in the ITL that provided help
