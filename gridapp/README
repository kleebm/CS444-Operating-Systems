My program has implemented grid,row and cell level locking. There are no extra
files needed to run this. I got it to work about 60% of the time for the row
and cell level locking. I could not figure out quite why it would work sometimes
and not other times. I noticed when it would have 10 threads, the smaller the 
grid got the more times it would fail. It was more consistent with lower thread
counts. I noticed that the row level locking seemed to be more consitent than the
cell level, especially at lower grid sizes.
